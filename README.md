# ATM-Project

This is a python project I wrote to learn python from scratch in few weeks. I started from the basic functionalities like printing out names, Login, Register, File I/O and creating a database. There are still lots of improvements to add to this project in the future, I would contiue to work on it, perhaps I could integrate it somewhere later in the future.
